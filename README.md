# Let WordPress check your index status!

This plugin checks once a day whether your WordPress website has been set to No-Index with the WP built-in No-Index function. If so, it will be set to index again.


# Installation


## 1. Download Git-Repository


## 2. Upload Plugin to WordPress & activate it

After activation you donÂ´t need to do anything. The Plugin will create a CronJob which checks your Site Index Status every 24 Hours. If your WordPress 'blog_public' option is set to true it will set it to false so your Website gets indexed.
